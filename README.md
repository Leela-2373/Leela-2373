Hi! I’m a former Software Developer at OPPO with a strong foundation in problem-solving and tech.  
I’m now pivoting my career towards Data Analytics because I enjoy uncovering patterns, insights, and stories hidden in data — more than coding itself.

🌟 Interests: Data visualization, business insights, dashboards, and impactful decision-making.
📚 Tools: Learning SQL, Excel, Power BI, Tableau.
🤝 Open to collaborating on analytics projects and learning from the community.
